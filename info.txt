 NOV 16, 2021             DANIELA PEREZ AND MARCUS KRUM

Qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is well underway, as countries compete to fill 32 spots in next year's showcase on the sport's greatest stage.

The competition, which will be held from Nov. 12-Dec. 18, 2022, will be the last 32-team edition before the 2026 World Cup across North America expands to 48 teams. Qatar secured its berth way back in December 2010, a bid process that has since been shrouded in controversy. In terms of allocation of the other berths, 13 spots go to Europe, five go to Africa, four and a half go to both Asia and South America, three and a half go to North and Central America and the Caribbean, and half to the Oceania region. Those "half" spots earned by teams send them to a pair of intercontinental playoffs for the last two places in the field. It will be determined on Nov. 26 which regions will be paired for the playoffs, whose format has changed.

With the qualifying cycle happening at different paces across the world due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, the vast majority of the first berths being clinched are coming out of Europe. The majority of the field will be set in March ahead of the April 1 draw, while the two winners of the inter-confederation playoffs will be determined in June.

Here's who has qualified for the 2022 World Cup and where qualifying stands for those still vying for berths.

Qualified teams so far:

Qatar (Host), Germany, Spain, Denmark, Croatia, Brazil, Serbia, Belgium, England, Switzerland, France, Netherlands, Argentina

Which teams are in the play-offs?

How does the European playoffs work?

Three more European qualification berths are up for grabs. The six seeded teams will face off in a single-leg semifinal matches, before another round of three single-leg play-off finals to decide the three qualified teams.

Andriy Shevchenko named as Genoa coach
The 45-year-old Shevchenko signed a contract until June 2024.

Genoa hired former AC Milan and Chelsea forward Andriy Shevchenko as coach on Sunday, a day after firing Davide Ballardini.

The 45-year-old Shevchenko signed a contract until June 2024.

Shevchenko quit his only previous coaching position, in charge of Ukraine, in August. He steered the national team to the European Championship quarterfinals for the first time in its history before being eliminated by England.

Genoa's new American owners, private investment firm 777 Partners, acted after just one win in 12 Serie A matches this season.

"Kicking off this new adventure to bring back Genoa to its great history," Shevchenko said in a post on Instagram.

Genoa is the oldest soccer club in Italy but won the last of its nine Italian league titles in 1924. It has often found itself fighting relegation in recent years and Friday's draw at Empoli left it in the drop zone and led to Ballardini's dismissal.

"Genoa announces that Andriy Shevchenko has reached an agreement with 777 Partners and will lead the Grifone until June 30, 2024," Genoa said in a statement, before naming some of Shevchenko's achievements as a player and coach.

"Genoa and 777 Partners warmly welcome coach Shevchenko and wish him a fruitful time in charge of the oldest club in Italy."

“We have to remind UEFA who Real Madrid are” – Florentino Perez keeps up Super League push

The Super League dream lived and died in the space of one mad day back in April – except for in the mind of Florentino Perez.

While clubs across Europe were shamed into backing down almost instantly, and apologies were made across the board, Perez doubled down, and more than 6 months later he is still keeping the dream alive.

Speaking today at the Real Madrid general assembly today, he took the chance to sell the idea to his own season ticket holders once again.

“The Super League isn’t just a tournament – it tries to change the dynamic of football because if we don’t do anything, football will die,” he insisted.

Football – which of course existed happily for a very long time without Super Leagues, and could continue to function with no issues even if every top club collapsed – seems fairly healthy to us.

Barcelona says Xavi Hernandez to become first team coach on a contract until 2024, replacing the sacked Ronald Koeman.


Xavi played for Barcelona for 17 years, making 767 appearances and winning 25 trophies, including four Champions League wins and eight league titles

Futbol Club Barcelona have named former midfielder and captain Xavi Hernandez as head coach on a contract until 2024, following the sacking of Ronald Koeman.

The La Liga club received the green light on Friday to sign the 41-year-old after they paid the release clause in his contract with Qatari side Al-Sadd.

“FC Barcelona have reached an agreement with Xavi Hernandez for him to become first team coach for the rest of the current season and two more seasons,” the club said in a statement that was headlined “WELCOME BACK HOME, XAVI!”

Barjuan is set to remain in charge for their league match at Celta Vigo on Saturday, with Xavi arriving in Barcelona this weekend before his presentation on Monday.

“It wasn’t goodbye, it was ‘see you soon’. The Camp Nou has always been my home,” Xavi said in a video addressed to the fans.

“You’re my fans, my people, the club that I love the most. And now, I’m coming home. See you soon, Culers. Forca Barca!”

Xavi will also be charged with improving the team’s style of play, which was a key criticism during the tenure of Koeman, another former Barca player.

Robert Lewandowski learn more about Premier League

The Bayern Munich hitman has often been linked with a move away from Germany, and Manchester City and Chelsea have most recently been tagged as interested.

Lewandowski was eager hear about the league from new Poland team-mate Matty Cash during the international break, according to The Athletic.

The Aston Villa right-back recently joined up with Paulo Sousa' s side for the first time after his switch of allegiance.

It is stated that the 33-year-old, who is among the favourites to win the Ballon d'Or later this month, took Cash aside for a 30-minute chat upon his arrival, quizzing him about the division.

Their conversation comes off the back of City manager Pep Guardiola bumping into Lewandowski last week, with Poland preparing to face Andorra at a training camp in Spain.

Guardiola, there to visit his brother who partially owns Girona, coached the striker in Munich and has described him as 'the most professional player he has ever worked with.'

Before Chelsea's capture of Romelu Lukaku, the Blues were believed to be looking at Lewandowski.

Sergio Aguero retires from football due to heart problems
He has been sidelined after suffering an arrythmia

Sergio Aguero will reportedly hang up his boots following his heart issue, which has sidelined him since Barcelona's 1-1 home draw against Alaves on October 30.

The Argentine forward joined Barcelona on a free transfer after parting ways with Manchester City last summer, but he was sidelined due to an injury in the first stretch of the season and only made his debut against Valencia on October 17.

As the journalist and Radio MARCA contributor Gerard Romero said on his Twitch channel, Aguero will announce his retirement in a press conference scheduled for next week.

In total, he played 165 minutes for Barcelona in LaLiga Santander and Champions League before leaving the pitch against Alaves due to chest discomfort.

Medical exams showed that Aguero suffered an arrhythmia and although those around him have tried to play down scenarios regarding a potential retirement, the Argentine has decided to call it a day with his football career.

Liverpool legend makes Kylian Mbappe transfer interest 

Kylian Mbappe is yet to agree a new contract at Paris Saint-Germain and has been linked with a summer transfer to Liverpool


Former Liverpool forward Ian Rush believes Kylian Mbappe would be a perfect fit for his old club amid continued speculation linking the Frenchman with a move to Anfield.

The 22-year-old has entered the final year of his contract with Paris Saint-Germain and is yet to agree terms on a fresh deal.

Mbappe will be available on a free transfer next summer and can sign a pre-contract agreement with clubs outside of France in January.

The World Cup winner has been offered two different proposals by PSG to extend his stay at the Parc des Princes, but is yet to put pen to paper.

And when asked about his PSG future following France’s World Cup qualifier against Kazakhstan last week, the forward refused to pledge his long-term future to the club.

He said: "I have spent five extraordinary years here [at PSG], I have taken advantage of every moment and I continue to do so.

“I am happy both on the pitch and in my personal life. Now there are many things, great challenges and I have already spoken about that. I'm here, I'm still here, I'm here this season."

And Rush believes that Mbappe is one of the very few players who could improve Liverpool's attacking power, and wants his former club to pursue the young star.

Manchester United board decide to sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after emergency meeting
 
United delivered one of the worst first-half performances of Solskjaer’s tenure at Vicarage Road as they were two goals down by the break. Donny van de Beek scored to give United a lifeline but Harry Maguire’s red card ended hopes of a comeback as Claudio Ranieri’s side went on to score twice more in injury time.

The result leaves United with five defeats in their last seven Premier League games and after the match the club’s hierarchy held talks to determine Solskjaer’s future.

According to The Times, United have now made the decision to dismiss Solskjaer, with the report claiming that the club’s owners believe the Norwegian and his coaching team have made a side ‘less than the sum of its parts’.

The report also claims that United will pay £7.5 million in compensation to Solskjaer, who signed a new contract in July which was due to run until 2024.

It’s understood that the Glazer family have now instructed United’s hierarchy to step up their pursuit of Zinedine Zidane as the former Real Madrid boss is their first-choice candidate to replace Solskjaer.

Meanwhile, Manchester Evening News reports that Darren Fletcher, who was appointed as United’s technical director in March, is in the frame to take charge of the team on an interim basis.
