Andriy Shevchenko named as Genoa coach
The 45-year-old Shevchenko signed a contract until June 2024.

Genoa hired former AC Milan and Chelsea forward Andriy Shevchenko as coach on Sunday, a day after firing Davide Ballardini.

The 45-year-old Shevchenko signed a contract until June 2024.

Shevchenko quit his only previous coaching position, in charge of Ukraine, in August. He steered the national team to the European Championship quarterfinals for the first time in its history before being eliminated by England.

Genoa's new American owners, private investment firm 777 Partners, acted after just one win in 12 Serie A matches this season.

"Kicking off this new adventure to bring back Genoa to its great history," Shevchenko said in a post on Instagram.

Genoa is the oldest soccer club in Italy but won the last of its nine Italian league titles in 1924. It has often found itself fighting relegation in recent years and Friday's draw at Empoli left it in the drop zone and led to Ballardini's dismissal.

"Genoa announces that Andriy Shevchenko has reached an agreement with 777 Partners and will lead the Grifone until June 30, 2024," Genoa said in a statement, before naming some of Shevchenko's achievements as a player and coach.

"Genoa and 777 Partners warmly welcome coach Shevchenko and wish him a fruitful time in charge of the oldest club in Italy."

Barcelona appoint club legend Xavi as head coach
Barcelona says Xavi Hernandez to become first team coach on a contract until 2024, replacing the sacked Ronald Koeman.

Futbol Club Barcelona have named former midfielder and captain Xavi Hernandez as head coach on a contract until 2024, following the sacking of Ronald Koeman.

The La Liga club received the green light on Friday to sign the 41-year-old after they paid the release clause in his contract with Qatari side Al-Sadd.

“FC Barcelona have reached an agreement with Xavi Hernandez for him to become first team coach for the rest of the current season and two more seasons,” the club said in a statement that was headlined “WELCOME BACK HOME, XAVI!”


“Xavi Hernandez, a youth team product at Barca, has left his current club, Al-Sadd of Qatar, after talks held over the last few days with the owners of the club.”

Dutch coach Koeman was sacked after a 1-0 defeat by Rayo Vallecano last month which left Barca, as it is commonly known, ninth in LaLiga.

The club are still in ninth place after Sergi Barjuan was appointed as caretaker coach and sit nine points behind leaders Real Sociedad with a game in hand.

Barjuan is set to remain in charge for their league match at Celta Vigo on Saturday, with Xavi arriving in Barcelona this weekend before his presentation on Monday.

“It wasn’t goodbye, it was ‘see you soon’. The Camp Nou has always been my home,” Xavi said in a video addressed to the fans.

“You’re my fans, my people, the club that I love the most. And now, I’m coming home. See you soon, Culers. Forca Barca!”


Xavi’s first game would be a local derby against Espanyol on November 20, after the international break.


A former Spain international, Xavi joined Al Sadd as a player in 2015, becoming the head coach after hanging up his boots in 2019. In April, he led his side to the Qatari domestic league title with the team unbeaten.

He turned down the chance to coach Barca in January 2020 after Ernesto Valverde was sacked, but remained linked with the job even after Koeman succeeded Quique Setien in August of last year.

Nicknamed the “Maquina” (the Machine), Xavi is widely considered one of Barcelona’s greatest-ever players and there is huge excitement about his potential as a coach after his influence on the iconic Barca team managed by Pep Guardiola.

His passing style was seen as the embodiment of Guardiola’s “tiki-taka” team that won the treble in 2009.


“One of the greatest midfield maestros of all time, he helped redefine the art with his creative mind, pinpoint passing and sublime ability to read the game,” Barca said in their statement, heralding the return of “an absolute legend”.

Xavi faces a formidable challenge after Barcelona let Lionel Messi join Paris Saint-Germain in the summer.

The club are also in dire financial straits, having posted debts of 1.35 billion euros ($1.6bn).

In Europe, Barca face a fight even to qualify for the knock-out stages of the Champions League while any rebuilding will have to be carried out on a shoestring budget as the club struggles to deal with the debts it partly built up paying Messi’s wages.

Xavi will also be charged with improving the team’s style of play, which was a key criticism during the tenure of Koeman, another former Barca player.

Steven Gerrard named new Aston Villa coach
November 11, 2021

Steven Gerrard has made a sensational return to the Premier League with his appointment as the new head coach of Aston Villa.

Gerrard speaking on his appointment said: “Aston Villa is a club with a rich history and tradition in English football and I am immensely proud to become its new Head Coach.

Helping them secure a record-breaking 55th league title will always hold a special place in my heart. I would like to wish the players, staff and supporters the very best for the future.”

Club CEO, Christian Purslow described Gerrard as having an ambition and philosophy that matches those of the West Midlands club.

Manchester United board decide to sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after emergency meeting
 Comment

Metro Sport Reporter
Saturday 20 Nov 2021 10:59 pm

United delivered one of the worst first-half performances of Solskjaer’s tenure at Vicarage Road as they were two goals down by the break. Donny van de Beek scored to give United a lifeline but Harry Maguire’s red card ended hopes of a comeback as Claudio Ranieri’s side went on to score twice more in injury time.

The result leaves United with five defeats in their last seven Premier League games and after the match the club’s hierarchy held talks to determine Solskjaer’s future.

According to The Times, United have now made the decision to dismiss Solskjaer, with the report claiming that the club’s owners believe the Norwegian and his coaching team have made a side ‘less than the sum of its parts’.

The report also claims that United will pay £7.5 million in compensation to Solskjaer, who signed a new contract in July which was due to run until 2024.

It’s understood that the Glazer family have now instructed United’s hierarchy to step up their pursuit of Zinedine Zidane as the former Real Madrid boss is their first-choice candidate to replace Solskjaer.

Meanwhile, Manchester Evening News reports that Darren Fletcher, who was appointed as United’s technical director in March, is in the frame to take charge of the team on an interim basis.

I know' - Liverpool legend makes Kylian Mbappe transfer interest claim
Kylian Mbappe is yet to agree a new contract at Paris Saint-Germain and has been linked with a summer transfer to Liverpool


ByConnor O'NeillFootball Writer

Former Liverpool forward Ian Rush believes Kylian Mbappe would be a perfect fit for his old club amid continued speculation linking the Frenchman with a move to Anfield.

The 22-year-old has entered the final year of his contract with Paris Saint-Germain and is yet to agree terms on a fresh deal.

Mbappe will be available on a free transfer next summer and can sign a pre-contract agreement with clubs outside of France in January.

The World Cup winner has been offered two different proposals by PSG to extend his stay at the Parc des Princes, but is yet to put pen to paper.

And when asked about his PSG future following France’s World Cup qualifier against Kazakhstan last week, the forward refused to pledge his long-term future to the club.

He said: "I have spent five extraordinary years here [at PSG], I have taken advantage of every moment and I continue to do so.

“I am happy both on the pitch and in my personal life. Now there are many things, great challenges and I have already spoken about that. I'm here, I'm still here, I'm here this season."

And Rush believes that Mbappe is one of the very few players who could improve Liverpool's attacking power, and wants his former club to pursue the young star.

“The Premier League is back this weekend after what was an eventful international break during which a few things caught my eye,” he told Gambling.com.

“I couldn’t help notice Kylian Mbappe was on fire for France, scoring five goals in two games. He looks on a mission to make up for what was a disappointing Euros campaign for him personally.

“He’s also in fine form for Paris Saint-Germain with six goals and six assists in 12 games in Ligue 1 this season. His form is all the more remarkable given the fact he’s made it clear he wants to leave PSG.

“The French champions refused to bow to Real Madrid in the summer but Mbappe now looks increasingly likely to run down his contract and leave PSG on a free transfer next year.


“Reports suggest the Bernabeu is where he’s destined to end up but when a player becomes a free agent you never know what direction they might take.

"We all thought Gini Wijnaldum was heading for Barcelona last summer only for PSG to snap him up.

“Could Liverpool hijack Mbappe’s proposed move to Real Madrid? I know he’s an admirer of Liverpool and in my opinion it would be great if the club could sign someone like him, but Real Madrid’s interest is strong and genuine.


“For me, if you want to play in the best league in the world and for the best club in that division, then there’s only one option and that’s the Premier League and Liverpool FC. It’s as simple as that.

“Ultimately, it will come down to what him and his agent believe is right for them, but if the opportunity is there I’d personally love to see Liverpool go in for him.

“I always say you should only sign players who are better than what you already have in that position. Is Mbappe better than what we currently have in his position? In my opinion yes, I think he’d make Liverpool a stronger team.”

Barca boss Xavi wants Salah ‘at all costs’ over ‘crazy’ Sterling
Date published: Sunday 14th November 2021 2:06 - Will Ford

Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold
New Barcelona boss Xavi is reportedly desperate to sign Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah as he looks to rebuild the team.

Barcelona are currently ninth in La Liga, 11 points behind league leaders Real Sociedad and recently replaced Ronald Koeman with Xavi.

The legendary midfielder has a tough task ahead of him to improve the dynamic and quality of the side, and is said to be looking to the Premier League for players.

Spanish outlet El Nacional (via Mirror) claims Xavi wants Salah ‘at all costs’, with the report citing Real Madrid’s pursuit of Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe as a possible reason for the chase of the star striker.

But Barcelona are said to be more than £1billion in debt and the club’s ability to sign Salah will depend on both their financial recovery and the player’s contract situation at Liverpool.

The Egyptian is out of contract in the summer of 2023 and Liverpool may look to cash in on the forward should he not sign a new deal this season.

The report states that Liverpool will do ‘everything possible’ to prevent Salah from leaving.

Xavi is a big admirer of Salah and described him as one of the best players in the world after Liverpool’s win over Flamengo in the Club World Cup final in 2019.

He said: “They [Liverpool] are one of the best teams in the world… they also have great players like Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and [Roberto] Firmino.

“Salah is one of the top 10 players in the world right now and always gives his best performance. I’ve watched him in the final, he is a great player and deserves to get the best player of the tournament award.”

Barcelona have also been linked with Raheem Sterling – a more likely acquisition.

Sterling has slid down the pecking order under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, has stated his desire for more game time, and now, according to Sport, now has a ‘crazy’ desire to leave the Etihad.

Reports suggest Barcelona could look to sign the City star in January with a view to making the move permanent in the summer.

Xavi’s preference is Salah, but he is also a huge fan of Sterling.

In 2019, Xavi said: “You look at young players who can be crowned the future best in the world and you still think of Neymar, Mbappe, Salah and of course Sterling.

“I look at the moment – and Sterling is winning that race. He’s always been a good player, a dangerous player, but under Pep he become one of the best in the world.

“I know how Pep works – he would have worked closely with him since his arrival – where he needs to improve and what he needed to work on.

“We’re now seeing the results of that – he’s still young and can be the world’s best.”

Sergio Aguero retires from football due to heart problems
He has been sidelined after suffering an arrythmia

Sergio Aguero will reportedly hang up his boots following his heart issue, which has sidelined him since Barcelona's 1-1 home draw against Alaves on October 30.

The Argentine forward joined Barcelona on a free transfer after parting ways with Manchester City last summer, but he was sidelined due to an injury in the first stretch of the season and only made his debut against Valencia on October 17.

As the journalist and Radio MARCA contributor Gerard Romero said on his Twitch channel, Aguero will announce his retirement in a press conference scheduled for next week.

In total, he played 165 minutes for Barcelona in LaLiga Santander and Champions League before leaving the pitch against Alaves due to chest discomfort.

Medical exams showed that Aguero suffered an arrhythmia and although those around him have tried to play down scenarios regarding a potential retirement, the Argentine has decided to call it a day with his football career.


**************************************************************************************************************************************************

Robert Lewandowski is reportedly keen to learn more about Premier League amid reports of a potential transfer to an English club.

The Bayern Munich hitman has often been linked with a move away from Germany, and Manchester City and Chelsea have most recently been tagged as interested.

Lewandowski was eager hear about the league from new Poland team-mate Matty Cash during the international break, according to The Athletic.

The Aston Villa right-back recently joined up with Paulo Sousa' s side for the first time after his switch of allegiance.

It is stated that the 33-year-old, who is among the favourites to win the Ballon d'Or later this month, took Cash aside for a 30-minute chat upon his arrival, quizzing him about the division.

Their conversation comes off the back of City manager Pep Guardiola bumping into Lewandowski last week, with Poland preparing to face Andorra at a training camp in Spain.

Guardiola, there to visit his brother who partially owns Girona, coached the striker in Munich and has described him as 'the most professional player he has ever worked with.'

Before Chelsea's capture of Romelu Lukaku, the Blues were believed to be looking at Lewandowski.

And following Lukaku's return to Stamford Bridge, a report emerged outlining the Poland captain's desire for a new challenge.

However, Bayern are set to begin talks over a fresh contract in the new year, with their prolific No.9 currently tied down until June 2023.

Having broken countless records in recent years, including the late Gerd Muller 's 40-goal Bundesliga haul which stood for 39 years, Lewandowski is targeting a first Ballon d'Or triumph on November 29.

Some have suggested he would benefit from proving his prowess in the Premier League, although the master marksman thinks otherwise.

“We have to remind UEFA who Real Madrid are” – Florentino Perez keeps up Super League push

The Super League dream lived and died in the space of one mad day back in April – except for in the mind of Florentino Perez.

While clubs across Europe were shamed into backing down almost instantly, and apologies were made across the board, Perez doubled down, and more than 6 months later he is still keeping the dream alive.

Speaking today at the Real Madrid general assembly today, he took the chance to sell the idea to his own season ticket holders once again.

“The Super League isn’t just a tournament – it tries to change the dynamic of football because if we don’t do anything, football will die,” he insisted.

Football – which of course existed happily for a very long time without Super Leagues, and could continue to function with no issues even if every top club collapsed – seems fairly healthy to us.

Playing to the crowd, Perez also turned his ire on UEFA, who had fought the proposed Super League from the start.

“We have to remind UEFA who Real Madrid are.”

As it stands, they are a club standing almost on their own, ploughing a lone furrow of self-interest.
